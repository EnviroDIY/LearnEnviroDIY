Remember that the overall goal of this training is to prepare you to use the EnviroDIY Modular Sensors Library for environmental monitoring.

In this lesson we will prepare you to use PlatformIO, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which is extremely helpful (and we believe necessary) for keeping track of libraries and code differences when using the EnviroDIY Modular Sensors sketches. You will install PlatformIO, which you will use to keep track of this complicated code library. PlatformIO has many features, including file management, syntax highlighting, code difference tracking, code debugging, library management, and integration with Arduino and GitHub.

The third segment will get you connected to GitHub, which is a web-hosting service for computer code repositories. This tutorial is hosted on GitHub, and the EnviroDIY Modular Sensor Library is also on GitHub. That means it is the source code manager for the code you will be using, so you will benefit from using GitHub to keep track of updates to the EnviroDIY Modular Sensor Library. You may also find it to be a useful place to keep track of your own codes to manage versions and share will collaborators.

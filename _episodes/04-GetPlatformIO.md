Remember that the overall goal of this training is to prepare you to use the EnviroDIY Modular Sensors Library for environmental monitoring.

In this lesson we will prepare you to use PlatformIO, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which is extremely helpful (and we believe necessary) for keeping track of libraries and code differences when using the EnviroDIY Modular Sensors sketches. You will install PlatformIO, which you will use to keep track of the complicated Modular Sensors library. PlatformIO has many features, including file management, syntax highlighting, code difference tracking, code debugging, library management, and integration with Arduino and GitHub.

Remember that the overall goal of this training is to prepare you to use the EnviroDIY Modular Sensors Library for environmental monitoring.

In this lesson we will prepare you to use PlatformIO, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which is extremely helpful (and we believe necessary) for keeping track of libraries and code differences when using the EnviroDIY Modular Sensors sketches. You will install PlatformIO, which you will use to keep track of the complicated Modular Sensors library. PlatformIO has many features, including file management, syntax highlighting, code difference tracking, code debugging, library management, and integration with Arduino and GitHub.

PlatformIO IDE is hosted within a text editor designed for editing code. Most code text editors highlight syntax and have special auto-complete features based on elements of the code. PlatformIO can be hosted by several text editors, so if you are a coder and already use VSCode or Sublime, please feel free to install PlatformIO for one of these editors. This tutorial will be presented from the perspective of PlatformIO hosted within Atom text editor. Since Microsoft took ownership of GitHub, their VSCode has become the "recommended" download for PlatformIO, but Atom and other editors still work great. If you choose a different text editor, some of the buttons will be located in different places, but all of the functionality will be preserved.

Install PlatformIO for atom.
https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=atom
After you download Atom, as described in the download link, you will go to Settings in Atom (gear symbol), select install (plus symbol) and type in `platformio-ide` in the box that says "search packages."

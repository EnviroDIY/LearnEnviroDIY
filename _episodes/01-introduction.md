Overall goal of this training is to prepare you to use the EnviroDIY Modular Sensors Library for environmental monitoring.

This lesson leverages interactive tutorials that are not directly related to environmental monitoring. We have intentionally chosen this approach to acquaint users to the broader world of Arduino format microcontrollers to demonstrate basic Arduino skills, including uploading, running, and modifying sketches; adding sensors; and managing libraries. The Arduino sketches in this module are simple and require a minimal number of libraries to run. We include a short note for each tutorial to help users know how elements of the tutorial will apply to their use of EnviroDIY Modular Sensors for environmental monitoring.

We strongly recommend that you actively participate in the activities in each tutorial because you will need to be comfortable with both physical connectivity to an Arduino and code edits prior to using EnviroDIY Modular Sensors Library.

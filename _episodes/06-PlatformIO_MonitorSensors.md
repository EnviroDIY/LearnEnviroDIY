## Part 1, Episode 6: Using PlatformIO

This lesson builds directly on Episode 6. We will interactively explore the features of PlatformIO and finalize your readiness for using the EnviroDIY Modular Sensors sketches in Part 2.

### Load your second sketch from PlatformIO to the Mayfly!
- Open the platformio.ini file in the LearnEnviroDIYcode project and type a ";" in front of the "example1" sketch, and uncomment the Example_02_Mayfly_blink.ino sketch to make that active.
- **Save the platformio.ini file.**
- Push the Build/Compile button (checkmark), and after that has completed, push the Upload button (right arrow).
- The Mayfly should blink as it did before, but now we will be able to check its status through the serial monitor by clicking the power plug button:

  You will be prompted to select your Port and Baudrate:

  The Baudrate is defined in the sketch as 9600.

  Regarding your port selection:

  **In Windows** your port will be `COM?`, where ?=some number (but it won't be `COM1`). Every Arduino board that you plug into your computer will be seen as a completely unique and new piece of hardware, and Windows assigns each a sequentially higher COM number (until it reaches 99, but that's a problem for another day).

  **In MacOS** your port will be a long string of gobbledygook with something about "usb" in the string (as shown above).
  Your serial output should look something like this:

When you are testing sensors in the Modular Sensors sketches, the serial monitor will help you confirm that all of your sensors are working correctly, which is an extremely useful thing.

### Oh hey! There's a sensor on the Mayfly!
- Your next task is to run Example_03_Mayfly_temp. We did not put it in the platformio.ini file for you. Please add it to the "ini" file, save, Build, Upload, and run it on the serial monitor.
  - Notes:
    - You can either type the file name into the "ini" file, or right-click on the directory (not the .ino file!) for Example 3 and select "Copy Project Path" (possibly two-finger click on MacOS, depending on your settings) and paste that into the "ini" file.  
    - The baud rate in the sketch is different and you need to manually select it in your serial monitor.
    - Your serial monitor should be outputting a temperature in degrees C once per second (or 1000 milliseconds).

### Set Real Time Clock on the Mayfly
-


### Connect OneWire sensor: DS18B20 waterproof temperature  



### Connect I2C sensors: BME280 temperature, pressure, and humidity and OLED display

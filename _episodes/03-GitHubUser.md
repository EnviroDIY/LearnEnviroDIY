Remember that the overall goal of this training is to prepare you to use the EnviroDIY Modular Sensors Library for environmental monitoring.  

This lesson will help you connect to GitHub, which is a web-hosting service for computer code repositories. This tutorial is hosted on GitHub, and the EnviroDIY Modular Sensor Library is also on GitHub. That means it is the source code manager for the code you will be using, so you will benefit from using GitHub to keep track of updates to the EnviroDIY Modular Sensor Library. You may also find it to be a useful place to keep track of your own codes to manage versions and share will collaborators.

First, here's a short introduction to one group's project using GitHub for collaboration. It's a little bit silly, but we like how it introduces the vocabulary of GitHub.

Go to https://github.com/ and "Sign Up" for GitHub (create your own user account).

Go to https://desktop.github.com/ and download and install GitHub Desktop. This software is a graphical user interface to help you manage the files that you get from (pull) or send to (push) GitHub repositories. Having a Git Client will allow you to (mostly) avoid command line interaction with GitHub. There are other Git Clients available, and you are welcome to explore and use them. Our tutorials will be from the perspective of GitHub Desktop simply because that is what was available when the authors started.

Your first GitHub activity.

Remember that the overall goal of this training is to prepare you to use the EnviroDIY Modular Sensors Library for environmental monitoring.  

This lesson will help you connect to GitHub, which is a web-hosting service for computer code repositories. This tutorial is hosted on GitHub, and the EnviroDIY Modular Sensor Library is also on GitHub. That means it is the source code manager for the code you will be using, so you will benefit from using GitHub to keep track of updates to the EnviroDIY Modular Sensor Library. You may also find it to be a useful place to keep track of your own codes to manage versions and share will collaborators.

You will need to set up a GitHub account and install GitHub desktop.
